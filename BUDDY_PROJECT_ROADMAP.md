# Buddy The Underwriter — Project Roadmap
# Institutional-Grade Commercial Lending AI Platform

**Last Updated: March 2026**
**Status: AAR 45 spec ready — BIE silent failures diagnosed, 3-file fix for Antigravity**

---

## Vision

Buddy is a commercial lending AI platform that processes financial documents,
performs underwriting analysis, and generates risk assessments for banks.

The north star: **every number that reaches a credit committee must be
correct, traceable, and defensible under audit — without requiring a human
to manually verify the math.**

**The goal: a banker opens a spread and focuses entirely on credit judgment.
They never wonder if the numbers are right. They already know they are.**

## The Accuracy Philosophy — Two Distinct Problems

**Problem 1 — Data accuracy verification.** TECHNICAL problem. Solvable with rigor.
**Problem 2 — Credit decision authority.** JUDGMENT problem. OCC SR 11-7 and FDIC
guidance require human oversight. Non-negotiable.
