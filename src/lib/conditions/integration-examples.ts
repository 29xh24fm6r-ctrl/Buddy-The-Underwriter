 * IMPORTANT:
 * This file is intentionally NOT executable code.
 * It exists as a scratchpad / reference for how integrations could work.
 *
 * DO NOT export Next.js route handlers (POST/GET) from this file.
 * DO NOT import this file from production code.
 *
 * If you need real endpoints, create:
 *   src/app/api/.../route.ts
 *
 * Keeping this file doc-only prevents TypeScript collisions like:
 * - "Cannot redeclare exported variable 'POST'"
 * - "Duplicate function implementation"
 * - Missing identifiers (uploadFile, classifyDocument, etc.)
